### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Madhurachanna

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in the intersection of Full-Stack Development and Agentic AI.

- **On the Frontend:** I build dynamic and responsive user interfaces with React, TypeScript, and Vue.js, focusing on performance and user experience.
- âš™**On the Backend:** I architect and deploy scalable microservices using Python (FastAPI, Flask), Node.js, and Go, all containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes on AWS and GCP.
- **In the AI Realm:** I design and develop autonomous multi-agent systems using CrewAI and MCP. I have hands-on experience integrating and fine-tuning various LLMs (Gemini, Llama, ChatGPT) to power agents that perform complex financial analysis, NLP tasks, and even control robotic systems.
